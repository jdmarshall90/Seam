## Asking Questions

Github is used for improving [Seam](https://github.com/nofelmahmood/seam) and adding new features. In case of any usage questions that are not specific to the project itself, please ask on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com). Doing this allows you to get answered quickly and also allows us to help others who might be in search of the answer to the same question.

## Reporting Issues

An awesome way to contribute to the project is to send a detailed issue when you encounter a problem. We always appreciate a well-written, thorough bug report.

Check that the project issues database doesn't already include that problem or suggestion before submitting an issue. If you find a match, add a quick "+1" or "I have this problem too." Doing this helps prioritize the most common problems and requests.

When reporting issues, please include the following:

- The version of Xcode you're using
- The version of iOS or OS X you're targeting
- The full output of any stack trace or compiler error
- A code snippet that reproduces the described behavior, if applicable
- Any other details that would be useful in understanding the problem

This information will help us review and fix your issue faster.
